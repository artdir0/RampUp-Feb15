	<h2>Plot</h2>
	<p>Andrew Neiman is a first-year jazz student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. He has been playing drums from a young age and aspires to become one of the greats like Buddy Rich. Conductor Terrence Fletcher accepts Andrew into his studio band as the alternate for Carl, the core drummer. Fletcher is abusive toward his students, mocking and insulting them; when the band rehearses the Hank Levy piece "Whiplash", Fletcher hurls a chair at Andrew for not keeping his tempo, and humiliates him in front of the class.</p>

	<p>Determined to impress Fletcher, Andrew practices until his hands bleed and breaks up with his girlfriend Nicole, believing she will distract him. At a local jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Carl's sheet music; as Andrew can perform "Whiplash" from memory, Fletcher promotes him to core drummer. However, Fletcher replaces him with Ryan, the core drummer from Andrew's former class.</p>

	<p>The next day, Fletcher tearfully reveals in class that a talented former student of his, Sean Casey, has died in a car accident. The band rehearses "Caravan", but Ryan struggles with the tempo; Fletcher auditions Andrew, Ryan and Carl for hours while the class waits outside despite all three struggling to keep tempo and finally gives the core position to Andrew.</p>

	<p>On the way to a jazz competition, Andrew's bus breaks down. Determined to make the performance, he rents a car, but arrives late for rehearsal without his drumsticks. He drives back to the car rental office and retrieves the drumsticks, but as he speeds back, his car is hit by a truck. He crawls from the wreckage and arrives on stage badly injured. When Andrew is unable to play, Fletcher tells him he is "done." Andrew attacks Fletcher in front of the audience before being dragged away.</p>

	<p>A few days later, Andrew is expelled from Shaffer and contacted by a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey. The lawyer explains that Sean actually hanged himself, having suffered anxiety and depression after joining Fletcher's class. Sean's parents want to prevent Fletcher from teaching; Andrew agrees to testify and as a result, Fletcher is fired.</p>

	<p>Months later, Andrew sees Fletcher performing at a club. They drink together and Fletcher explains that he pushes his students beyond the expected so they might achieve greatness. He invites Andrew to perform at a festival concert with his band. Andrew agrees and invites Nicole, but she is in a new relationship and declines.</p>

	<p>On stage, Fletcher reveals to Andrew that he knows he testified against him. In revenge, Fletcher leads the band in a new piece Andrew was not given sheet music for. Andrew leaves the stage humiliated, but returns and begins playing "Caravan", interrupting Fletcher as he addresses the audience. The rest of the band joins him, and, though surprised, Fletcher follows suit. Andrew ends the performance with an extravagant drum solo; Fletcher gives a nod of approval to Andrew as he finishes.</p>
